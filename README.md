1. INTRODUCTION:
With the increasing focus on sustainable transportation and the rise of urbanization, accurately predicting bike demand has become crucial for urban planners, bike-sharing programs, and bicycle manufacturers. Linear regression offers a straightforward method to model the relationship between various independent variables (such as time, weather conditions, and socio-economic factors) and the dependent variable (bike demand). To develop an accurate prediction model, historical data on bike rentals, including date, time, weather conditions, and special events, were collected and pre-processed. This involved running missing values, coding categorical variables, and measuring numerical features. Following data preprocessing, relevant features influencing bike demand were identified. These features included factors such as time of day, day of the week, weather conditions, public holidays, and special events, all of which could potentially impact bike rental patterns. Once the relevant features were determined, a linear regression model was trained using this data. Model performance was evaluated using standard metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared value to ensure its accuracy and reliability. The trained model was then used to make predictions on new data, allowing for insights into the factors influencing bike demand. The ultimate goal of this study is to support urban planners, bike-sharing programs, and bicycle manufacturers in making informed decisions regarding resource allocation, infrastructure planning, and meeting the needs of bike commuters and enthusiasts. By applying linear regression to predict bike demand, this research contributes to the development of sustainable transportation systems and helps address the challenges posed by urbanization and the increasing demand for environmentally friendly transportation options.

3. METHODOLOGY:
3.1 Data Collection:
3.1.1 Identify Data Sources
Gather historical data on bike rentals from sources such as bike rental companies, public bike-sharing systems, or open data repositories. The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information on daily demands, including data attributes such as date, time, weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation), and other relevant factors that might influence bike demand.
3.1.2 Data Attributes
Collect data attributes such as date, time, weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation), and any other relevant factors that might influence bike demand. In the dataset, the “season” variable is represented by the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, indicating the four seasons. Season one corresponds to January to March, season two to April to June, season three to July to September, and season four to October to December. The “year” variable is represented by the numbers 0 and 1, corresponding to the years. The “month” variable is recorded using the numbers 1 to 12, representing the months from January to December. The “holiday” variable is represented by 0 and 1, where 0 signifies “No” and 1 signifies “Yes.” The “weekday” variable is recorded using the numbers 0 to 6, corresponding to Monday to Sunday. The “working day” variable is represented by 0 and 1, with 0 indicating “No” and 1 indicating “Yes.” The “weather situation” variable is recorded using the numbers 1, 2, and 3, representing three different weather situations.
3.2 Data Preprocessing:
3.2.1 Handling Missing Data
Checking for missing values in the dataset is an essential step in data analysis and preprocessing. Null values, also known as missing values, refer to the absence of data in a specific variable or column. Understanding and handling null values is crucial because they can impact the accuracy and reliability of data analysis and modeling. There are no missing or Null values in either the columns or rows of our data collection, according to the check. If there are missing values, for numerical features, we will consider imputation techniques such as mean, median, or mode, while for categorical features, we will consider imputation with the mode (most frequent value). Finally, we will drop or impute missing values as appropriate.
3.2.2 Feature Engineering
In feature engineering, we extract relevant features from the dataset to enhance the predictive power of our model. From the date attribute, we extract features such as the day of the week, month, and season. Additionally, we create new features if necessary, such as a feature indicating whether it's a holiday or a working day. These new features provide valuable insights into how different factors influence bike demand, helping our model make more accurate predictions.
3.2.3 Handling Categorical Variables
Handling categorical variables is essential for building a robust predictive model. Categorical variables like weather situation, holiday, and working day need to be converted into numerical values for the model to process them effectively. We employ techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical values. One-hot encoding creates binary columns for each category, while label encoding assigns a unique numerical value to each category. This ensures that our model can interpret and learn from categorical data.
3.2.4 Scaling Numerical Features
Scaling numerical features is crucial for linear regression models, as they are sensitive to the scale of the input features. In our dataset, numerical features such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed may be measured on different scales. To ensure that these features contribute equally to the model, we use scaling techniques such as Min-Max scaling or Standard scaling. Min-Max scaling scales the data to a fixed range (usually between 0 and 1), while Standard scaling transforms the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Scaling our numerical features helps improve the performance and stability of our linear regression model.
3.3 Data Analysis:
3.3.1 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) refers to the process of visually and statistically exploring a dataset to understand its main characteristics, patterns, and relationships. It involves using various techniques to summarize, visualize, and interpret the data before diving into more formal modeling or analysis. EDA is a crucial step in the data analysis process as it helps analysts gain insights, detect anomalies, validate assumptions, and inform subsequent modeling or analysis decisions. By thoroughly exploring the data, analysts can make better-informed choices and develop a solid foundation for further analysis or modeling tasks. During EDA, analysts often compute summary statistics for numerical features such as mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values. They also generate visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to visualize the distribution of features and relationships between variables. Analyzing trends and patterns in bike demand over time is another essential aspect of EDA, helping analysts understand how different factors influence bike rentals. Additionally, correlation analysis is performed to identify relationships between features and the target variable (bike demand), often visualized using a heatmap to provide a clear overview of feature correlations.
3.3.2 Visualizations
Visualizations are powerful tools for understanding the data and identifying patterns. In this stage of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we generate histograms, box plots, and scatter plots to visualize the distribution of features and relationships between variables. Histograms allow us to visualize the distribution of numerical features such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. Box plots help us understand the distribution of numerical data and identify outliers. Scatter plots are useful for visualizing the relationship between two numerical variables, such as temperature and bike demand. Additionally, we analyze trends and patterns in bike demand over time. By plotting bike demand against time (e.g., daily, monthly), we can identify any seasonal or long-term trends. This analysis helps us understand how various factors, such as weather conditions and holidays, influence bike demand. Visualizing these trends is crucial for making informed decisions during the modeling process and identifying any patterns that may exist in the data.
3.3.3 Correlation Analysis
Correlation analysis is an essential step in understanding the relationships between features and the target variable (bike demand). We compute the correlation matrix to quantify the strength and direction of these relationships. By examining the correlation coefficients, we can identify which features are most strongly correlated with bike demand. To visualize these correlations effectively, we use a heatmap. The heatmap provides a visual representation of the correlation matrix, making it easy to identify patterns and relationships between different features. Brighter colors indicate stronger correlations, while darker colors indicate weaker correlations. This allows us to quickly identify which features have the most significant impact on bike demand and which features are less influential.
3.4 Data Splitting:
3.4.1 Split Data into Training and Testing Sets
To evaluate the performance of our linear regression model, we need to divide the dataset into training and testing sets. A common practice is to use 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing. This ensures that the model is trained on a sufficient amount of data while still having unseen data to evaluate its performance. It's crucial to split the data randomly to avoid any bias in the training or testing sets. Random splitting helps ensure that the data is representative of the overall dataset and that the model generalizes well to unseen data.
3.5 Model Selection:
3.5.1 Choose Linear Regression
Linear regression is a fundamental and widely used statistical method for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable (such as bike demand) and one or more independent variables (like weather conditions, time of day, etc.). The basic idea behind linear regression is quite intuitive: it assumes that there is a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable. In other words, as the input features change, the target variable changes by a fixed amount multiplied by the change in the input. For example, in the context of bike demand prediction, linear regression would predict the number of bikes rented based on factors like weather conditions and time of day. If we take weather conditions as an input feature, linear regression might suggest that for every increase in temperature by one degree, the number of bikes rented increases by a certain amount. One of the great advantages of linear regression is its simplicity. The model is easy to understand and interpret. For instance, the coefficients of the linear regression equation tell us how much the target variable is expected to change when the input features change by one unit. However, it's essential to remember that linear regression assumes that the relationship between the input features and the target variable is linear. In reality, this might not always be the case. Despite this limitation, linear regression is often used as a baseline model in machine learning projects due to its simplicity and interpretability. It can provide valuable insights into the relationships within the data and serve as a good starting point for more complex modeling techniques. Additionally, linear regression is computationally efficient and can handle large datasets with relatively low computational resources.
3.6 Model Training:
3.6.1 Train the Model
To train our linear regression model, we fit the model to the training data. This involves using the training data to learn the coefficients of the linear regression equation. The coefficients represent the slope and intercept of the linear equation, which best fits the training data. Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new data. Training the model involves finding the best-fitting line through the data points by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values. This process allows the model to learn the relationship between the input features and the target variable (bike demand) so that it can make accurate predictions on unseen data. Building a linear model for bike-sharing demand forecasting involves creating a model that uses linear regression to predict bike rental demand based on a set of input variables. The linear regression model is trained using the training set, with the input variables used to predict the target variable (bike rental demand). The model is optimized to minimize the error between the predicted and actual demands in the training set. We use the LinearRegression function from SciKit Learn and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to build our linear regression model. By utilizing these tools, we can effectively train our model and select the most relevant features for prediction. By building a linear model for bike-sharing demand forecasting, analysts can develop a simple yet effective forecasting system to optimize bike-sharing operations and improve customer satisfaction. However, it’s important to note that linear models may have limitations in capturing more complex patterns and relationships in the data, so other modeling techniques (such as decision trees or neural networks) can provide more accurate predictions.
3.7 Model Evaluation:
3.7.1 Evaluate Model Performance
To assess the performance of our linear regression model, we use appropriate evaluation metrics. Common regression metrics include:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE) represents the average error of the model predictions. It is calculated as the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values. MAE is useful for understanding the average magnitude of errors in our predictions. A lower MAE indicates better model performance, with 0 being the best possible score.

Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE) measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. It is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. MSE gives more weight to large errors and is useful for understanding the overall quality of the model's predictions. Like MAE, lower MSE values indicate better model performance, with 0 being the best possible score.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) provides the standard deviation of the residuals. It is calculated as the square root of the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values. RMSE is useful for understanding the spread of the errors in our predictions. RMSE is interpreted in the same units as the target variable, making it easy to understand in the context of the problem. As with MAE and MSE, lower RMSE values indicate better model performance.
R-squared (𝑅 2) score
R-squared (𝑅2) score indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. It is a measure of how well the independent variables explain the variability of the dependent variable. R-squared values range from 0 to 1, where 1 indicates a perfect fit and 0 indicates no relationship between the independent and dependent variables. A higher 𝑅2 score indicates better model performance, with 1 being the best possible score.
By evaluating our model using these metrics, we can determine its effectiveness and identify any areas for improvement. These metrics provide valuable insights into the performance of our linear regression model and help us understand how well it is predicting bike demand. Additionally, by comparing these metrics, we can select the best-performing model and fine-tune it further if necessary to improve its performance.
 
Fig. 1. Residual Analysis of Linear Regression
The error terms are distributed normally, satisfying one of the key assumptions of Linear Regression. This normal distribution indicates that the errors are symmetrically distributed around the mean, which is 0 in the case of a well-fitted linear regression model. Normality of the error terms is important as it ensures that the model is making unbiased predictions. Additionally, a mean of 0 indicates that, on average, the model is neither overestimating nor underestimating the target variable. This is crucial for ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the model predictions. By satisfying these assumptions, we can have more confidence in the validity of our linear regression model and the interpretation of its coefficients.
 
Fig. 2. Model Evaluation
The graph shows that the predicted values of y_test and actual y_test are highly correlated, indicating that the model is a good fit for the data. This correlation demonstrates that the model's predictions closely align with the actual values, suggesting that the model accurately captures the underlying patterns and relationships in the data. Additionally, the graph displays minimal dispersion around the line of perfect correlation, further confirming the model's reliability and predictive power. Overall, the strong correlation between predicted and actual values in the graph provides evidence that the linear regression model effectively predicts bike rental demand.
3.8 Predictions:
3.8.1 Make predictions on new data using the trained model
To make predictions on new data using our trained linear regression model, we use the "predict" function. In linear regression, the “predict” function is used to generate predictions or estimates of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables. It allows you to apply the learned relationship between the independent and dependent variables to new or unseen data. We will use the predict function in Python with the scikit_learn library to generate predictions using our final model. By applying our trained model to new data, we can forecast bike rental demand accurately, helping bike rental companies optimize their operations and improve customer satisfaction. This process ensures that our model can generalize well to new, unseen data, making it a valuable tool for making future predictions.

4. RESULT:
The analysis of the linear regression model revealed several important findings. The model exhibited high R-squared and adjusted R-squared values, indicating a strong fit. Additionally, the high F-value and low Prob(F) value further confirmed the model's suitability. Among the features, season_spring and weathersit_Rainy emerged as significant predictors with high negative coefficients, suggesting their importance in the model. Conversely, mnth_Nov showed a relatively high p-value (0.096), indicating it may not be a significant factor. Subsequent analyses involved iteratively refining the model by dropping less significant features and simplifying its structure. Ultimately, the final model included significant features such as temp, season_spring, and mnth_Sep, while dropping less influential variables like mnth_July. The model equation was derived, providing a clear understanding of how each feature impacts bike rental demand. The final model demonstrated a good fit, with its coefficients providing valuable insights for business decisions. For instance, it was observed that biking counts increase in September when the temperature is moderate, but decrease during rainy, misty days, or holidays. This information can help bike rental companies optimize their operations and better meet customer demand.
5. CONCLUSION:
In conclusion, this study has developed a predictive model for forecasting the demand for shared bikes in a bike-sharing system, identifying significant influencers such as temperature, season, month, weekday, and weather conditions. Practical implications include strategic station placement near landmarks frequented by users, planning for peak rental hours, dynamic pricing based on seasonal variations, infrastructure development along popular routes, optimizing maintenance schedules, and customer engagement through weekend discounts and coupons. These recommendations aim to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of bike-sharing systems. For instance, most rentals are for commuting to workshops and colleges on a daily basis, suggesting that bike-sharing systems should consider launching more stations near these landmarks to better serve their main customer base. Additionally, planning for additional bikes at stations during peak rental hours, particularly from 7–9 am and 5–6 pm, can help align resources with periods of high demand. Implementing dynamic pricing based on seasonal variations can encourage bike usage, particularly during the fall and winter seasons. Data on the most used routes can inform the development of dedicated bike lanes or roads, promoting safer and more efficient cycling. Conducting bike maintenance during low-usage hours, such as at night, can minimize disruption to customers, and offering discounts and coupons on weekends can increase weekend bike usage and promote overall system utilization. However, it's important to acknowledge the model's limitations and the need for further research to ensure generalizability. Nonetheless, this study provides a solid framework for future research and offers valuable insights for bike-sharing system operators and urban transportation planners.
